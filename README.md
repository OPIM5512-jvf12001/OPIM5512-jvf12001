## Hi, my name is Joe Fontanarosa. I work in the Institutional Research Office at UConn and I am currently pursuing my MS in Data Science here at the university.

  This semester in particular I will be learning:
    - More in-depth usage of machine learning tools
    - Techniques to better preproccess data 
    - Data modeling skills



This is my first time using GitHub, and just found out how many random emogis are available. I can't say I'll ever have a reason to use a camel in a project so I've got to do it here. 🐫🐫🐫
